# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

My code for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/). If you're interested, I encourage you to try the problems yourself before looking at anything here.

## Structure

This is a cargo workspace with a binary crate for each day. You can read about workspaces and how to use them in [Part 14.3 of *The Rust Programming Language*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html)

## License

See COPYING.WTFPL. I'm offering the code under the WTFPL because it has limited practical use, and I don't want people learning Rust to be afraid of cribbing things from the exercises here.

I wrote the following paragraph last year, and it still holds true for me, so I've copied and pasted it here. If there's new territory in FOSS licensing, I haven't heard about it, 

For your own projects, I'd recommend reading [Post-Open Source](https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/13/post-open-source.html) and the works linked within before choosing. I would not recommend reading Post-Open Source if you're in a vulnerable place emotionally, because my first read through it filled me with dread about the state of software and computing. This is not to say it's necessarily perfect. I haven't done a ton of research thanks to the aforementioned dread, but by my estimation it's a well-reasoned and researched piece, so it'll be a good jumping-off point for your license decisions.
